# Contributing to AI Guardian Lab

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report.
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.

### Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Run the tests (`verify_security.py` or `verify_logging.py`) to ensure existing functionality is not broken.
3.  Ensure your code follows existing style (clean Python/Shell).
4.  Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup
Refer to `README.md`'s "Quick Start" section. 
You can run the stack locally with:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Security
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Email the maintainer directly or fix it in a private fork first.
